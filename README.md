# Iris-Classifier
A simple deep neural net for classifying iris flowers into 3 categories:

  1. Iris Setosa
  2. Iris Versicolor
  3. Iris Virginica

Classification is done from 4 features:

  1. Sepal length in cm
  2. Sepal width in cm
  3. Petal length in cm
  4. Petal width in cm

The program downloads the training and testing datasets, training the model and saving it in the tmp/iris_model folder in the current directory, before testing and calculating accuracy.

Accuracy achieved: 96.66%

## Requirements
* Python 3.*
* Tensorflow  1.13.1  
* NumPy       1.16.4
