# Iris-Classifier
A simple deep neural net for classifying iris flowers into 3 categories:

  1. Iris Setosa
  2. Iris Versicolor
  3. Iris Virginica

Classification is done from 4 features:

  1. Sepal length
  2. Sepal width
  3. Petal length
  4. Petal width

The program downloads the training and testing datasets, training the model and saving it in the tmp/iris_model folder in the current directory, before testing and calculating accuracy.
